# SaaS Metrics Analytics Platform

A modern data analytics platform demonstrating end-to-end data engineering with industry-standard tools.

## Project Overview

This project showcases the transition from traditional BI tools to modern data stack architecture, featuring synthetic SaaS company data with realistic patterns for MRR, churn, and user engagement.

## Tech Stack

- **Data Generation**: Python, Pandas, Faker
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Transformation**: dbt (data build tool)
- **API**: FastAPI
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript *(planned)*

## Current Features

Realistic SaaS data generation (10K users, 467K events)  
PostgreSQL data warehouse  
dbt models for key metrics:
  - Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)
  - Churn rate analysis
  - Cohort retention *(coming soon)*

## What This Demonstrates

- Modern data stack architecture
- SQL transformation best practices with dbt
- Data modeling (dimensional modeling)
- Version-controlled analytics
- Production-ready data pipelines
